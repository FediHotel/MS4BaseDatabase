MS4 Base Database
This git repository contains the base database for the MS4 Habbo Hotel Emulator, which is based on the Arcturus Emulator. The database includes all of the individual tables and data needed for a "basic" Habbo Hotel experience when using Arcturus Morningstar.

The repository currently contains 122 tables. In the releases section, you can find a download of the latest tables combined as one .sql file. This file can be imported into your database management system to set up the base database for your MS4 server.

Please note that this is just the base database and additional tables and data may be required for a fully functional server. Also if you find any issues or have any questions, please open an issue in the repository.
